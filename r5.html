	<aside> I began this project by having a friend scan me while sitting still. 
		I took the scanned file and editied it in Mesh Mixer and made it solid which filled in all of the holes.
		I used the smoothing tool and othertransformation tools to alter the shape and texture of my head. 
		I imported a previously designed pedistal from Thingaverse and used the combine tool to attach myself to the base.
		I then exported the file into the MakerBot software and 3D printed it. 
		I am happy with how this turned out, and it is a little strange to see a 3D image of me, especially with all the details.

	<aside> I began my design that could not be made subtractivley in Fusion360.
		Going into the project I didn't really know what I wanted to create, but as I messed around with creating shapes I made something pretty cool. 
		I first drew a 10x10 square and extruded it, then skeched smaller 9x9 square on the surface of the larger square. 
		I then extruded the smaller sqaure compelely and was left with a holew with a frame. 
		I did this process for the other sides, and what remained was the frame of the cube.
		I then used a simmilar method to insert a cylinder inside the cube.
		By removing one side of the cylinder thorugh extrusion, I was left with an hourglass shape and decied to end my design here. 
		I made sure everyting was attatched before exporting it into MakerBot and then printing it.
		I think my final design looks pretty cool and I'm happy with the result.

	<aside> For the useful project, Graicen and I designed a comb using Fusion360. 
		We began by sketching a rectangle then attatching smaller rectangles to one side to make the teeth. 
		Once everyting was attatched, we extruded it and exported it into MakerBot and printed it. 
		I had my doubts as to how this would turn out, however I was pleasently suprised with the final result. 
		While the comb is small and the teeth aren't exactly normal length, it still fuctions as it is supposed to.
