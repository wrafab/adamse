<h1> Hello! My name is Erin Adams. I am sixteen years old and was born in Akron, Ohio. I was raised in Kent, Ohio until I was four, and now my family and I live in Hudson, Ohio. My family consist of my two wonderful parents, my older brother Ian, and our dog Kelty. My family and I love to go on camping trips during the summer months in our pop-up camper, and we always enjoy spending our free time outdoors. I currently attend Western Reserve Acadamy in Hudson as a sophomore. I feel privileged to attend such a prestigious school where I feel welcome, loved, and at home. My favorite subjects are science and art, and I have a great time studying and relaxing with my friends in the dorms. I enjoy spending time with my friends in school and around downtown Hudson, and I love hanging out with my two favorite cousins Anna and Emma who live in Green and Kent. 

Irish Dance has been a huge part of my life ever since I started when I was five years old, when I discoverd the McCulloch School of Irish Dance . I grew to love the sport and I learned to love competing in feis' (competitions). In 2013 I won the u13 Regional Solo Championships and became my dance schools fist champion dancer. Winning that title pushed me to work even harder and now I have to opportunity to travel to Ireland annually to compete in the World Open Championships. I competed in the World Open Championships in 2015 and 2016 where I placed 12th and 15th, and I plan to compete in the years to come. 

I have become an active leader in my Irish Dance school. I have begun teaching and assisting my teacher Karen with the younger students. Through teaching I have found a genuine love for kids, which I think is very important to establish early in life. I know what it is like to be the adult in situations and accept responsibility, which I also think are essential qualities to have. I have grown to be hardworking, dedicated, respectful and loyal through my love of family, learning, and Irish Dance.
